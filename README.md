# hepa-public
PUBLIC COPY of the repository for analysis of data from HEPA pilots, beginning in June 2023, last updated June 2024. Supersedes all previous HEPA analysis repositories.

Primary authors of this project are [VedaantKuchhal](https://github.com/VedaantKuchhal),  [sanjatti](https://github.com/sanjatti), [ndhulipala1](https://github.com/ndhulipala1), and [giauyentran](https://github.com/giauyentran).

All of the information relevant to this project is documented in a set of documents called Data Guides. The [main data guide](https://github.com/airpartners/hepa-public/blob/main/data_guide.md) can be found as `data_guide.md` and it outlines the entire project and therefore the contents of `cleaning`, `analysis`, `summary`, and `insight` (as well as `data` and `artifacts` - two untracked folders that will be added in the process of running this pipeline). It's the necessary starting point to understanding and building on this project.

As for the other files/folders, they're fairly boring.

* `.gitignore` un-tracks the files and folders that shouldn't be tracked by git.
* `hepa-public.Rproj` is the R Project file. There are many ways to start running the code in this project, but one of the most favorable ways is going to RStudio, clicking on "File --> Open Project" and navigating to and clicking on this file.

Once again, you really just need to read the [data guide](https://github.com/airpartners/hepa-public/blob/main/data_guide.md).

Cheers, and don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any questions!
